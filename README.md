An annotated Neovim Lua plugin template with `pre-commit`, StyLua, selene,
and GitHub actions included from the start.

## Setup

> [!NOTE]
> The script is subject to breaking changes in the future.
> Therefore please review the instructions below.

To configure the template simply run `generate.sh` in your terminal:

```bash
./generate.sh # Has to be run in the repository root!
```

It'll invoke many prompts so that you may structure your plugin as desired.

**The script will delete itself after a successful setup!**
